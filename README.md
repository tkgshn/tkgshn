I currently committing to the future of public goods funding. what's the "good" and "Public", how are we beyond private/public?

Founder of @DeCartograophy . which can provide social diversity score based on a human subjective evaluation of address activity as a computational oracle in Ethereum. based

Developers using this oracle can retrieve the Plurality Social Diversity of a given wallet address and other wallet addresses or groups (which is a list of wallet addresses) in GraphQL.

The data used to generate the social graph is determined by the crowdworker. Crowd workers are rewarded by solving Common Sense Task displayed on the platform.

The goal is to collect subjective ratings from each crowd worker and use the “wisdom of crowds” to provide a social graph that is as close to objective as possible.

Previously, I founded @Civichat. which is a chatbot. all of the citizens in Japan can find eligible public welfare services. for example, scholarships, national insurance, and more, public goods provided by your government. but, we could proof-of-concept but they didn't pay for us. just freeride.

so, I was so depressed and decided to leave Japan.

I’m really excited about Optimism’s RetroPGF and Gitcoin (Quadratic Funding) like that. So, our protocol (DeCartography) can use to adjust voting power based on each wallet’s Social diversity score on Quadratic Funding. but, it’s just one use case.

let’s chat. come on twitter@0xcommune or takagishunsuke1129@gmail.com !
