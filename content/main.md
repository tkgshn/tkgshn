**Taka**（高木俊輔）

Independent researcher of governmentality who wants to make the world more simplified.

I love the art of governance as the coordination but I hate most of government. So I'm here in Ethereum. The power of the market is super intelligence by human coordination. Alignment game, Crypto Economics, Radical Market and Plurality.

Most of time is NEET, sometimes Consulting and Trading (both words mean the same thing). Formerly I founded Civichat, Inc. to optimize social welfare. But it was hard to make money so now it's open-sourced and became a Digital public goods & community.

Just based on curiosity, Writing, building, reading and making gathering places.

Based in Tokyo 🗼, sometimes living a nomadic life around the world 🌎.

Inspired by the works of [Ayn Rand](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E8%82%A9%E3%82%92%E3%81%99%E3%81%8F%E3%82%81%E3%82%8B%E3%82%A2%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9-%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E9%83%A8-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89/dp/4908222010) and [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X).

## Background & projects

### Recommend eligible social welfare services

Founded [Civichat, Inc.](https://web.archive.org/web/20230323052013/https://www.civichat.jp/) in 2020 while receiving support during my time at [N High School](https://nnn.ed.jp/news/blog/archives/11586/). The mission was to leverage technology to reduce the selection gap—that is, the situation where individuals miss out on beneficial social welfare services simply because they were unaware of them (**"If only I had known, I would have chosen it!"**). To address this, we developed a system to recommend eligible social welfare services.

<a href="https://gyazo.com/d58773deb874803c2ecbfb195c41ad0c">

</a>

Specifically, our approach involved rewriting eligibility conditions written in natural language into a formal logical language. By doing so, determining whether a user qualifies for a particular program becomes equivalent to solving an inclusion problem between hyper-polyhedra (i.e., the "hyper-polyhedral inclusion test" as demonstrated in [this simulator](https://codepen.io/tkgshn/full/vEYYVeK)).

Moreover, we recognized that traditional software interfaces—where welfare services appear merely as objects—make it difficult for users to discern how and whether they can use them. Therefore, we designed the system with a conversational UI that asks users for their personal information, effectively identifying which services are applicable.

The project secured venture capital funding and conducted PoCs (Proof of Concepts) with local governments in Japan. However, sustaining the company as a profitable entity proved challenging, and the initiative has since transitioned to an open-source community project: [OpenFisca Japan](https://github.com/project-inclusive/OpenFisca-Japan).

Leveraging my expertise at this career, I am currently providing consulting services to government offices.

#### CEO Experience and Business Insights

Founded Civichat and served as CEO for approximately three years. During that period, I gained valuable experience in several areas:

- **Startup Founding and Leadership**: Founded the startup, secured venture capital funding, and led recruitment efforts. Faced the challenges of failure and upheld accountability as CEO.
- **Product Management (PdM)**: Managed various resources while tackling the complexities of product development.
- **Full-Stack Software Architecture**: Oversaw the design of comprehensive software architecture—from requirements definition and algorithms to data structures and UI—although I did not engage in hands-on coding.
- **Service Delivery and Revenue Challenges**: While our client-facing services (targeting citizens) achieved strong engagement, we struggled to identify sustainable revenue models, particularly when it came to monetizing services for government bodies.

In summary, although the project succeeded in terms of product development and social impact, it ultimately did not succeed as a business.

### Digital Public Goods Sustainability: Hack, Research and Experiment with the community

After Civichat was suspended, I began researching the sustainability of digital public goods.
The central question: "Why are physical public goods supported by governments, while digital public goods are not?"

This exploration led me deep into the world of digital public goods, especially within the Ethereum ecosystem:

#### [DeCartography](https://github.com/DeCartography/)

- Aimed at providing a reliable and neutral social graph through web3 crowd-sourcing.
- However, contrary to the hypothesis, the result showed [COCM mechanism](https://wtfiscocm.streamlit.app/COCM_Sandbox) worked effectively.

- This project couldn't achieve cost-effective balance and was suspended!
