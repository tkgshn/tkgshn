### Professional Background

#### Social Welfare Service Recommendation

Founded [Civichat, Inc.](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226095739/https://www.civichat.jp/) in 2020.
The mission was to create a system to recommend eligible social welfare services using formal languages like DSL.
Secured venture capital funding and conducted PoCs (Proof of Concepts) with local governments in Japan.

However, sustaining the company as a profitable entity was challenging.
The project has since transitioned to an open-source initiative maintained by the community: [OpenFisca Japan](https://github.com/project-inclusive/OpenFisca-Japan).

#### Community and Researching Digital Public Goods Sustainability

After Civichat was suspended, I began researching the sustainability of digital public goods.
The central question: "Why are physical public goods supported by governments, while digital public goods are not?"

This exploration led me deep into the world of digital public goods, especially within the Ethereum ecosystem:
- Attempted to build [DeCartography](https://github.com/DeCartography/), a project that turned out to be overly complex!
- Worked on [Democratic grant allocation using Quadratic Funding in DigDAO for civic tech projects](https://www.digdao.jp/en/projects/matching-donation/).
- Contributed to [RadicalxChange](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1SOqaLPWvITp8OLRSqSv-YdMY56EcV_r5IBrSXzuWgNA/edit#heading=h.8pclttbqzay) and the [Plurality Book](https://www.plurality.net).
- Hosted [Funding the Commons Tokyo '24](https://www.fundingthecommons.io/tokyo-2024), serving as a bridge between the web3 and public sectors globally, representing [Japan](https://plurality.tokyo).
